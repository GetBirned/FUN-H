## Authentication

- AJAX-powered registration and login with no page reloads.
- Error handling and form validation for user feedback.

Example from `scripts.js`:

```javascript
$("form[name=signup_form").submit(function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    var formData = $(this).serialize();
    $.ajax({
        url: "/user/signup",
        type: "POST",
        data: formData,
        success: function(response) {
            console.log("Signup successful.");
        },
        error: function(error) {
            console.log("Signup failed.");
        }
    });
});
```
